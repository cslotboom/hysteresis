The following examples show basic usage of the Hysteresis objects:

* 2.1 Basic Seismic Damper: an example working with 'clean' input data from a seismic damper.
* 2.2 Basic Seismic Damper: an example working with 'messy' experimental data, as well as comparing two hystereses.
* 2.3 Seismic Damper 1: A hands off example showing how to get cumulative energy in a seismic damper
* 2.4 Seismic Damper 2: A hands off example showing how to get cumulative energy in a seismic damper
