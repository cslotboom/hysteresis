The following examples show basic usage of the Hysteresis objects:

* 2.1 Basic Seismic Damper: an example working with 'clean' input data from a siesmic damper.
* 2.2 Basic Seismic Damper: an example working with 'messy' experimental data, as well as comparing two hystereses.
* 2.3 Siesmic Damper 1: A hands off example showing how to get cumulative energy in a siesmic damper
* 2.4 Siesmic Damper 2: A hands off example showing how to get cumulative energy in a siesmic damper
