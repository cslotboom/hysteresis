    Compares two Curve objects by resampling them using linear interplation,

    Parameters
    ----------
    Curve1 : Curve
        The first curve, must be non-Hysteresis.
    Curve2 : Curve
        The second curve, must be non-Hysteresis.
    Nsample : int
        The number of samples that the comparison curves will have.
    sampleFunction : function, optional
        The sample function to be used to compare the curves. 
        The default function is "defaultSampleFunction".

    Returns
    -------
    diff : float
        The net difference between each curve.
