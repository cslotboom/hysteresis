Seismic Damper with Noisey Data
========

The following example showcases how to work with 'messy' experimental data, as well as comparing two hystereses.
The following experimental data and numerical analysis data is used:

#. Experimental data  :download:`here </examples/02 Basic Usage/2.2 Hysteresis with Noisey Data/TS1_Experiment_Shear.csv>`.
#. Analysis reaction force data :download:`here </examples/02 Basic Usage/2.2 Hysteresis with Noisey Data/Ts1_Load_Dsp.out>`.
#. Analysis displacement data for :download:`here </examples/02 Basic Usage/2.2 Hysteresis with Noisey Data/Ts1_Wall_Reaction.out>`.
