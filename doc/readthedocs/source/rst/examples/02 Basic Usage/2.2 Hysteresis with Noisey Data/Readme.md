<h1 align = "Left">Wall 'Messy' Data Example.</h1>

An more complex example analyzing data from a shear wall. 
The data from this study is very messy, and manual effort is needed to accurately find the propreties of the hysteresis.

* 2.2.1 - Basic Plotting: reviews basic features of the hysteresis package
* 2.2.2 - Finding Reversal Points: shows how to clean the input data experimenta and find reversal points.
* 2.2.1 - Basic Plotting: shows how to compare to different hysteresis.
